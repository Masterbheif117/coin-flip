# Coin Flip Simulator

## Overview
The Coin Flip Simulator is a simple yet engaging front-end project that lets users virtually flip a coin to see if it lands on heads or tails. This simulator, however, adds a twist to the classic coin flip - the odds arenâ€™t the standard 50/50. Users can experience different probabilities, making each flip uniquely unpredictable.
