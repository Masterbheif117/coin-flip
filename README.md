Coin Flip Simulator
Overview
The Coin Flip Simulator is a simple yet engaging front-end project that lets users virtually flip a coin to see if it lands on heads or tails. This simulator, however, adds a twist to the classic coin flip - the odds arenâ€™t the standard 50/50. Users can experience different probabilities, making each flip uniquely unpredictable.

Features
Interactive Coin Flip: Click a button to simulate a coin flip.
Adjustable Probability: Unlike traditional coin flips, this simulator can be set to favor heads or tails, allowing for probabilities other than 50/50.
Animation Effects: Watch the coin flip through an animation on the screen, enhancing the user experience.
Results Display: After each flip, see the result displayed dynamically on the page.
